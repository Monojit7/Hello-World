# WARNING - 
**Not yet updated for new GitHub location of Common API, and new pathnames (capicxx-*) !**

(Please fix it and send pull request)

----

A bash script encoding of all the steps in:

"CommonAPI C++ D-Bus in 10 minutes (from scratch)"

URL: https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5472316


Just run the script to make CommonAPI ready:

./build-*.sh


I still recommend you go through the manual steps to learn how to do this
in general - that's the idea of the tutorial of course.  The purpose of
storing the example files already created, and scripting it is mostly to
prepare a simple automated test.
