This is a producer and consumer problem in which producer has max limit of 5 when this is reached , producer has to wait ( semaphore )
till consumer is consuming atleast one item whereas when there is no item is produced consumer has to wait ( semaphore )

Producer wait will be unblocked by consumer sem_post after decrementing stock_count of the item.
Consumer wait will be unblocked by producer sem_post after incrementing stock_count of the item.

Producer production rate is twice ( 1 sec wait ) than consumer consumtion rate( 2 sec) .

So Producer after incrementing the value go the max limit and Wait in that.
Consumer than consume the item by decrementing the value.
