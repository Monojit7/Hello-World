Instead of calling copy constructor , copy elimission technique directly push the data into existing constructor

B ob = "copy me";

When compiler does not optimize:

B ob = B("copy me"); // copy constructor called

                     // constructor called


When compiler optimize:

B ob = "copy me";

B ob("copy me");
